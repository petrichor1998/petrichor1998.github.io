  abstract = {We present a novel neurosymbolic system called NeSyFOLD that classifies images while providing a logic-based explanation of the classification. NeSyFOLD's training process is as follows: (i) We first pre-train a CNN on the input image dataset and extract activations of the last layer filters as binary values; (ii) Next, we use the FOLD-SE-M rule-based machine learning algorithm to generate a logic program that can classify an image -- represented as a vector of binary activations corresponding to each filter -- while producing a logical explanation. The rules generated by the FOLD-SE-M algorithm have filter numbers as predicates. We use a novel algorithm that we have devised for automatically mapping the CNN filters to semantic concepts in the images. This mapping is used to replace predicate names (filter numbers) in the rule-set with corresponding semantic concept labels. The resulting rule-set is highly interpretable, and can be intuitively understood by humans. We compare our NeSyFOLD system with the ERIC system that uses a decision-tree like algorithm to obtain the rules. Our system has the following advantages over ERIC: (i) NeSyFOLD generates smaller rule-sets without compromising on the accuracy and fidelity; (ii) NeSyFOLD generates the mapping of filter numbers to semantic labels automatically.},

  abstract = {Humans understand language by extracting information (meaning) from sentences, combining it with existing commonsense knowledge, and then performing reasoning to draw conclusions. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT are able to leverage patterns in the text to solve a variety of NLP tasks, they fall short in problems that require reasoning. They also cannot reliably explain the answers generated for a given question. In order to emulate humans better, we propose STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show how LLMs can be used to effectively extract knowledge -- represented as predicates -- from language. Goal-directed ASP is then employed to reliably reason over this knowledge. We apply the STAR framework to three different NLU tasks requiring reasoning: qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversation. Our experiments reveal that STAR is able to bridge the gap of reasoning in NLU tasks, leading to significant performance improvements, especially for smaller LLMs, i.e., LLMs with a smaller number of parameters. NLU applications developed using the STAR framework are also explainable: along with the predicates generated, a justification in the form of a proof tree can be produced for a given output.},
