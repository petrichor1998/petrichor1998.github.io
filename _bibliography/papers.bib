  abstract = {Deep learning models such as CNNs have surpassed human performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification. However, despite their sophistication, these models lack interpretability which can lead to biased outcomes reflecting existing prejudices in the data. We aim to make predictions made by a CNN interpretable. Hence, we present a novel framework called NeSyFOLD to create a neurosymbolic (NeSy) model for image classification tasks. The model is a CNN with all layers following the last convolutional layer replaced by a stratified answer set program (ASP). A rule-based machine learning algorithm called FOLD-SE-M is used to derive the stratified answer set program from binarized filter activations of the last convolutional layer. The answer set program can be viewed as a rule-set, wherein the truth value of each predicate depends on the activation of the corresponding kernel in the CNN. The rule-set serves as a global explanation for the model and is interpretable. A justification for the predictions made by the NeSy model can be obtained using an ASP interpreter. We also use our NeSyFOLD framework with a CNN that is trained using a sparse kernel learning technique called Elite BackProp (EBP). This leads to a significant reduction in rule-set size without compromising accuracy or fidelity thus improving scalability of the NeSy model and interpretability of its rule-set. Evaluation is done on datasets with varied complexity and sizes. To make the rule-set more intuitive to understand, we propose a novel algorithm for labelling each kernel's corresponding predicate in the rule-set with the semantic concept(s) it learns. We evaluate the performance of our "semantic labelling algorithm" to quantify the efficacy of the semantic labelling for both the NeSy model and the NeSy-EBP model.},

      abstract = {Within the realm of deep learning, the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly in the context of image classification tasks, remains a formidable challenge. To this end we present a neurosymbolic framework, NeSyFOLD-G that generates a symbolic rule-set using the last layer kernels of the CNN to make its underlying knowledge interpretable. What makes NeSyFOLD-G different from other similar frameworks is that we first find groups of similar kernels in the CNN (kernel-grouping) using the cosine-similarity between the feature maps generated by various kernels. Once such kernel groups are found, we binarize each kernel group's output in the CNN and use it to generate a binarization table which serves as input data to FOLD-SE-M which is a Rule Based Machine Learning (RBML) algorithm. FOLD-SE-M then generates a rule-set that can be used to make predictions. We present a novel kernel grouping algorithm and show that grouping similar kernels leads to a significant reduction in the size of the rule-set generated by FOLD-SE-M, consequently, improving the interpretability. This rule-set symbolically encapsulates the connectionist knowledge of the trained CNN. The rule-set can be viewed as a normal logic program wherein each predicate's truth value depends on a kernel group in the CNN. Each predicate in the rule-set is mapped to a concept using a few semantic segmentation masks of the images used for training, to make it human-understandable. The last layers of the CNN can then be replaced by this rule-set to obtain the NeSy-G model which can then be used for the image classification task. The goal directed ASP system s(CASP) can be used to obtain the justification of any prediction made using the NeSy-G model. We also propose a novel algorithm for labeling each predicate in the rule-set with the semantic concept(s) that its corresponding kernel group represents.},

  abstract = {Humans understand language by extracting information (meaning) from sentences, combining it with existing commonsense knowledge, and then performing reasoning to draw conclusions. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT are able to leverage patterns in the text to solve a variety of NLP tasks, they fall short in problems that require reasoning. They also cannot reliably explain the answers generated for a given question. In order to emulate humans better, we propose STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show how LLMs can be used to effectively extract knowledge -- represented as predicates -- from language. Goal-directed ASP is then employed to reliably reason over this knowledge. We apply the STAR framework to three different NLU tasks requiring reasoning: qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversation. Our experiments reveal that STAR is able to bridge the gap of reasoning in NLU tasks, leading to significant performance improvements, especially for smaller LLMs, i.e., LLMs with a smaller number of parameters. NLU applications developed using the STAR framework are also explainable: along with the predicates generated, a justification in the form of a proof tree can be produced for a given output.},

      abstract = {Achieving human-like communication with machines remains a classic, challenging topic in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Natural Language Processing. These Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on pattern-matching rather than a true understanding of the semantic meaning of a sentence. As a result, they may generate incorrect responses. To generate an assuredly correct response, one has to "understand" the semantics of a sentence. To achieve this "understanding", logic-based (commonsense) reasoning methods such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably needed. In this paper, we describe the AutoConcierge system that leverages LLMs and ASP to develop a conversational agent that can truly "understand" human dialogs in restricted domains. AutoConcierge is focused on a specific domain-advising users about restaurants in their local area based on their preferences. AutoConcierge will interactively understand a user's utterances, identify the missing information in them, and request the user via a natural language sentence to provide it. Once AutoConcierge has determined that all the information has been received, it computes a restaurant recommendation based on the user-preferences it has acquired from the human user. AutoConcierge is based on our STAR framework developed earlier, which uses GPT-3 to convert human dialogs into predicates that capture the deep structure of the dialog's sentence. These predicates are then input into the goal-directed s(CASP) ASP system for performing commonsense reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, AutoConcierge is the first automated conversational agent that can realistically converse like a human and provide help to humans based on truly understanding human utterances.},

  abstract = {Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.},

  abstract = {Recent efforts in interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focus on translating the activation of CNN filters into a stratified Answer Set Program (ASP) rule-sets. The CNN filters are known to capture high-level image concepts, thus the predicates in the rule-set are mapped to the concept that their corresponding filter represents. Hence, the rule-set exemplifies the decision-making process of the CNN w.r.t the concepts that it learns for any image classification task. These rule-sets help understand the biases in CNNs, although correcting the biases remains a challenge. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework called NeSyBiCor for bias correction in a trained CNN. Given symbolic concepts, as ASP constraints, that the CNN is biased towards, we convert the concepts to their corresponding vector representations. Then, the CNN is retrained using our novel semantic similarity loss that pushes the filters away from (or towards) learning the desired/undesired concepts. The final ASP rule-set obtained after retraining, satisfies the constraints to a high degree, thus showing the revision in the knowledge of the CNN. We demonstrate that our NeSyBiCor framework successfully corrects the biases of CNNs trained with subsets of classes from the "Places" dataset while sacrificing minimal accuracy and improving interpretability.},
