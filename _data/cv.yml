    - title: "NeSyFOLD: A Framework for Interpretable Image Classification"
      institution:  Parth Padalkar, Huaduo Wang, Gopal Gupta @AAAI 2024, oral presentation (<4\% selection rate)
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Introduced a neurosymbolic framework, NeSyFOLD, aimed at creating interpretable predictions for image classification tasks, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
        - A rule-set generated from the CNN, along with the CNN serves as the interpretable model for making predictions. Showed an average increase of 8% in accuracy and an 83% reduction in rule-set size than previous SOTA.

    - title: Using Logic Programming and Kernel-Grouping for Improving Interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks
      institution: Parth Padalkar, Huaduo Wang, Gopal Gupta, @Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL) 2024
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Improved on NeSyFOLD. Developed a novel algorithm for grouping the outputs of similar kernels in the CNN.
        - Showed that using groups of kernels for generating a rule-set leads to comparable performance and a 14% drop in the rule-set size on average, than using individual kernels.

    - title: Automated interactive domain-specific conversational agents that understand human dialogs
      institution: Yankai Zeng, Abhiramon Rajasekharan, Parth Padalkar, et a., @Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL) 2024
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Developed a chat-bot using LLMs and logic programming that is more reliable than using an LLM-based chatbot.
        - Showed application as a hotel concierge that can recommend restaurants with more reliability than Bing AI.

    - title: Reliable Natural Language Understanding with Large Language Models and Answer Set Programming
      institution: Abhiramon Rajasekharan, Yankai Zeng, Parth Padalkar, Gopal Gupta, @International Conference on Logic Programing (ICLP) 2023
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Proposed STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to improve reasoning in natural language understanding tasks.
        - Applied the STAR framework to tasks involving qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversations and demonstrated its superior performance to vanilla LLMs.
