I am a Ph.D. student currently working with [Dr. Gopal Gupta](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/) at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning and logic programming. My current research focus is on extracting logical rules from CNNs to facilitate explainability
of the models. 

Outside of research I like playing tennis, learning new songs on my keyboard, reading and wondering about new appplications for AI.
