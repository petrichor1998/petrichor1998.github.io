I am a Ph.D. student currently working with [Dr. Gopal Gupta](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/) at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning and logic programming. My current research focusses on extracting logical rules from CNNs to facilitate explainability
of the models.
